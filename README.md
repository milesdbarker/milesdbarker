### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miles Barker (he/him), and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I am about to graduate so I am currently looking for a software engineering job! If you are hiring, let me know at milesdbarker@gmail.com. I also generally love meeting new people so feel free to connect on LinkedIn

I have recently been interested in making Discord bots. I have been collaborating with [Hayden](https://github.com/Koalacards), another Northeastern Computer Science student.

**Bots:**
[Doxcord](https://github.com/Koalacards/Doxcord) is a fun bot that assigns fake information to users in the server. Current functionality includes fake names, addresses, phone numbers, blood types, and more. Users can always opt out, and we make sure that all information is not real in any way.

[Sus-O-Meter](https://github.com/Koalacards/Sus-O-Meter) is a bot that looks through message history in the server and determines the most 'sus' users. Servers can decide their own word list used, and includes functionality in English and Spanish!

**Other Work:**
Last summer (2021), I worked at the [People's Collaborative Governance Network](https://collabgov.mit.edu/). It was an incredible internship that focused on a co-design process. As a student, you are generally told what to program and given mostly clearly specifications. This intership showed me the importance of the design process in making something that will actually be useful to the intended users.
